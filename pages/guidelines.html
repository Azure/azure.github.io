          Before you start working on a feature or substantial code
          contribution please <a href="/contact/">discuss it</a> with
          the team and ensure it is an appropriate addition to the core

          Note that code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and
          tested by the Microsoft Azure SDK Team (or the appropriate
          Azure service owners), and only contributions that meet
          an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap
          appropriateness will be merged into the source.</p>

          In some situations Microsoft employees may engage with you
          to review design decisions and mitigate issues as part of
          the contribution process. Understand that in some situations,
          developers inside Microsoft may decide to decline your
          pull request and instead log the issue for a future
          product milestone or bug fix. The team will provide
          information in the pull in these situations and still
          thank you for your contribution.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          For bug fixes, simply start a conversation in the related
          GitHub issue to notify the team and chat about the design of
          the fix if needed.</p>

        <p class="lead">
          There are many opportunities to build value-add services and
          frameworks that do not need to direct alterations to the
          SDKs and products: NuGet packages for .NET or NPM modules
          for Node.js devs can easily take a dependency on the core
          SDK components, for example.

        <p class="lead">In order to obtain the source code you need to become familiar
          with Git (see <a href="http://progit.org/book/">http://progit.org/book/</a>)
          and Github (see <a href="http://help.github.com/">http://help.github.com/</a>)
          and you need to have Git installed on your local machine. You can
          obtain the source code from Github and start a contributor environment by
          following the these steps on your local machine:
        </p>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="card text-xs-left centered-steps">
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">

              <li class="list-group-item">Select <img src="/images/button-fork.jpg" alt="fork"/> and choose your own
                Github account as target
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Clone the repository on your local machine with the following
                Git command: <br>
                <code>git clone git@github.com:[USERNAME]/[PROJECT]</code></li>
              <li class="list-group-item">When you clone the repository you should see, at least, 2 branches: dev and
                master. dev is the
                branch where the team does all the day to day development while master is the branch that is always
                up to date with the latest release. This means, before starting any work, you should switch to the
                dev branch. You can do so with the following command:<br><code>git checkout dev</code>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="featurette-subtitle">Create bug fixes and features</div>

        <p class="lead">You can then start to make modifications to the code in your local Git repository.
          This can be done in your local dev branch or, if you prefer, in a branch out of dev.
          In the simplest scenario, working directly on dev, you can commit your work
          with following commands:<br/>
        </p>
        <div class="container">

              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Push your changes from your local repository to your github fork<br/>
                <code>git push</code>

            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="lead">Once your code is in your github fork, you can then submit a pull request
          for the team's review. You can do so with the following commands:<br/>
        </p>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="card text-xs-left centered-steps">
            <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">

              <li class="list-group-item">In the pull request select your fork as source and
                Azure/[PROJECT] as destination for the request
              </li>
              <li class="list-group-item">Write detailed message describing the changes in the pull

            </ul>

        </div>

        <p class="lead">If there are conflicts between your fork and the main project one, github
          will warn you that the pull request cannot be merged. If that's the case,
          you can do the following:

        <p class="lead">Please keep in mind that not all requests will be approved.
          Requests are reviewed by the Core Team on a regular basis and will
          be updated with the status at each review. If your request is

        <p class="lead">
          The Microsoft Azure SDK team has an active Microsoft discussion
          group used for submitting code reviews and discussing design
          changes, best practices, and other important topics.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Part of the code review process involves using a code review
          tool, and for most open source projects, the team uses the
          built-in Pull Request functionality on GitHub for enabling
          annotations and comments on code before accepting the pull
          request/s.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Expect a good amount of feedback as part of any pull request:
          not only which branch to merge to and from, but also
          consistency guidelines, matching existing code, and
          making targeted, smart changes when fixing bugs.

          The SDK team is considering allowing for community code
          reviews as well. If you watch a repository of interest,
          you can make comments on any public pull request. The
          best time for providing feedback is during dev branch
          pulls into the primary Azure GitHub organization.
